# Creating a chess engine using bitboards

## Description

I've made chess interfaces a few times, but never efficient enough to be the foundation for a strong chess engine. 
The bitboard technique uses 64 bit integers to represent the chess board, and makes use of many nifty efficiency optimizations that follow
from using integers.
